	#PORT SOLVER
Port over my solver from java. Need to include a bunch of methods --Med priority

	#VISUAL
Needs feedback for victory state. 
	*-> What happens when I win? Disable controls and RESET?


	#INPUT
Take touch input. 		--Med priority
Handle held-down input. --Low priority. Not important for this game.

	#CODE FORMATTING
Clean up the files. Add things to gitignore and all that good stuff!
Clean up #includes properly
Re-logic all magic numbers.
Seperate GFX into dedicated files.
	*->Need to work on END and START being in sudokugfx. This is causing reliance of other gfx classes. MB just remove
		and let the controller handle it? Means controller will depend on sf2dlib as well.
		Maybe make some kind of controller for all gfx classes that sudokucontroller calls.

	#Functionality
Add Main menu
	*-> difficulty

	#MAKEFILE
Set it up to save correctly. Into a dedicated folder for 3DS files.

	#OPTIMIZE 
draw only when change occurs //Only start frame when needed
