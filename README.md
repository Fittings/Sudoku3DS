#Sudoku3DS - Version 1.0

This is a sudoku game for the 3ds using the SF2DLIB by xerpi
A first project to learn the libraries. 
This went beyond my original scope, so the structure was a little out of hand. 
There are still some features I would like to add, however it's complete enough that I'll release as is and 
put those into my next 3DS project.
